# neuroc
A compiler Project by Nitesh n Nilay
A symbol table is used (written on the top of DFA_reader.c file) to find the index of the input character. Accordingly a pair (int alpha, int state) is stored in state data structure, alpha refers to input character index and state is the final state.
A array of states is maintained.
