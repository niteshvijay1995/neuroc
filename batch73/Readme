Note -  All the 4 options are working.

Instructions to run assembly code:
1. first install the follwing library by typing the below command on terminal
	$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
2. Now when you run code by step 3 of Instructions, and generate assembly code using option 7, you'll be asked if you want to execute assembly code (only when the output file is named "code.asm"). Press y for yes and then you can enter the input for the program.

3. Exclusively you can run the asm code by giving the following commands (considering file is code.asm):
	$ nasm -f elf code.asm -o code.o
	$ gcc -m32 code.o -o code.out
	$ ./code.out
